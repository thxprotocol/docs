A protocol fee is charged when making a deposit to your asset pool. Currently the fee percentage parameter set in the assetpool registry is 0 and therefor no fees are substracted from the deposit amount.

## Pool Registry
The pool registry is used to store important protocol parameters. These parameters will become governable in the near future. Currently asset pools read the `feeCollector` and `feePercentage` parameters from this registry.

## Fee Collector 
Charged fees will be collector by the fee collector contract. Periodically this contract will swap the tokens it collected for THX tokens. These tokens can be claimed by registered THX users that hold THX tokens in their THX wallets oon Polygon L2.

## Claim your fees
You will be able to use THX Wallet to claim your periodic allocation and transfer the THX tokens from the fee collector contract to your THX wallet address.

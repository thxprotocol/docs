## Govern the protocol
THX is a governance token. THX holders govern the parameters of and improvements to the protocol. This includes voting on managing the ‘Community Treasury’, the ‘Community Distribution’ and ‘Community Incentives’. 

At first this is done with gasless voting using Snapshot.org starting in Q1 2022, and later through on-chain governance.

## Claim protocol fees
Upon community vote, and if so decided by the community, the token is able to accrue protocol fees which in turn are distributed to token holders by a mechanism that performs market buys of our native token using the fees collected.


## Incentives for usage
Planned for the end of Q1 of 2022, upon voting by token holders, including the early stage investors, liquidity mining or usage incentives will be established.

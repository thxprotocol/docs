## AssetPoolFactory Status
This section provides information about the AssetPoolFactory which is responsible for deploying asset pools. The `deployed` property checks if bytecode exists at the given `address` and the `healthy` property compares the bytecode for the ABI in the project with the bytecode found on chain. This is meant to ensure the use of the correct factory.

```json {3-8}
{
    ...
    "factory": {
        "deployed": true,
        "healthy": true,

All available endpoints are described in our [Swagger docs](https://api.thx.network/v1/docs). They should inform you about the request format they expect and what kind of responses will be given.

## Asset Pools

Asset Pools are configured with an ERC20 token contract. Assets of this type can be stored in the pool. Only by claiming rewards these assets can be withdrawn from the pool. Asset Pools can be configured to enforce an extra layer of security by setting poll duration properties to a fair amount of seconds.

[API Specification](https://api.thx.network/v1/docs/#/Asset%20Pools) | [Examples](../asset_pools)

## Rewards

Rewards configured for the pool define the amount of assets a member can withdraw from the pool. Rewards can either be given automatically or claimed actively by pool members.

[API Specification](https://api.thx.network/v1/docs/#/Rewards) | [Examples](../rewards)

## Members 

Members can receive or claim rewards and (if enabled) participate in the governance of the reward configuration. Members can be promoted to managers to also participate in the governance of withdrawals (if enabled).

[API Specification](https://api.thx.network/v1/docs/#/Members) | [Examples](../members)

## Withdrawals

Withdrawals are created when rewards are given or claimed. 

[API Specification](https://api.thx.network/v1/docs/#/Withdrawals) | [Examples](../withdrawals)

## Polls

Polls are created for reward and withdrawal operations. They share the same identifier but have a slightly different interface. The poll endpoints are used to integrate governance flows in your app.

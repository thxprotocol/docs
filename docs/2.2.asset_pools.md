## 1. Create Asset Pool

This example script will deploy an asset pool and configure the ERC20 address in the payload as its asset type.

```javascript
axios({
    url: 'https://api.thx.network/v1/asset_pools',
    method: 'POST',
    data: {
        title: 'Volunteers United',
        token: '0x278Ff6d33826D906070eE938CDc9788003749e93',
    }
})
```

## 2. Asset Pool Configuration

You can elevate the security of the assets in your pool by configuring governance for high risk pool interactions. You can do this by setting the `rewardPollDuration` and `withdrawPollDuration` default properties in seconds for your pool.

:::info
**Reward Poll Duration:** This is the duration of the poll started when a new rewards is configured for the pool or when a change is required for the size of an existing reward.
:::

:::info
**Withdraw Poll Duration:** This is the duration of the poll started when a member has been given or claims a reward. Managers should approve the withdrawal before the poll ends to enable the member to withdraw the reward.
:::

This example script will set the rewardPollDuration to **3 days** (`259200` seconds) and the withdrawPollDuration to **7 days** (`604800` seconds). 

If you choose to automatically approve all polls, you should set `bypassPolls` to `true`. When finalizing a poll, the duration and vote counts will be ignored and the poll will automatically be approved.

**Request:**

```javascript
axios({
    url: 'https://api.thx.network/v1/asset_pools/0x278Ff6d33826D906070eE938CDc9788003749e93',
    method: 'PATCH',

    },
    data: {
        bypassPolls: false,
        rewardPollDuration: 259200,
        proposeWithdrawPollDuration: 604800,
    }
})
```

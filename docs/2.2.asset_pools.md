## 1. Create Asset Pool 

### 1.1 Existing ERC20 token contract

This example script will deploy an asset pool and sets `0x278Ff6d33826D906070eE938CDc9788003749e93` as the pool token.

```javascript
axios({
    url: 'https://api.thx.network/v1/asset_pools',
    method: 'POST',
    data: {
        title: 'Volunteers United',
        token: '0x278Ff6d33826D906070eE938CDc9788003749e93',
    }
})
```

### 1.2 Deploy ERC20 UnlimitedSupply token contract

This example script will deploy an asset pool and connect a new ERC20 token contract with `name` ABC Token and `symbol` ABC. 

Since no `totalSupply` property is given the supply will be infinite and minted by the asset pool when an outgoing transfer occurs.

```javascript
axios({
    url: 'https://api.thx.network/v1/asset_pools',
    method: 'POST',
    data: {
        title: 'Volunteers United',
        token: {
            name: 'ABC Token',
            symbol: 'ABC'
        }
    }
})
```

### 1.3 Deploy ERC20 LimitedSupply token contract

This example script will deploy an asset pool and connect a new ERC20 token contract with `name` ABC Token and `symbol` ABC. 

Since the `totalSupply` property is provided the supply will be finite.

:::info
**Limited Supply:** Tokens with a limited supply are scarce and have the potential to gain monetary value when publically traded.
:::

```javascript
axios({
    url: 'https://api.thx.network/v1/asset_pools',
    method: 'POST',
    data: {
        title: 'Volunteers United',
        token: {
            name: 'ABC Token',
            symbol: 'ABC',
            totalSupply: 1000000000,
            to: '0x0739955a6d72cf8a30fef5af66ccb8Fb0d0aC20B',
        }
    }
})
```

## 2. Asset Pool Configuration

You can elevate the security of the assets in your pool by configuring governance for high risk pool interactions. You can do this by setting the `rewardPollDuration` and `withdrawPollDuration` default properties in seconds for your pool.

:::info
**Reward Poll Duration:** This is the duration of the poll started when a new rewards is configured for the pool or when a change is required for the size of an existing reward.
:::

:::info
**Withdraw Poll Duration:** This is the duration of the poll started when a member has been given or claims a reward. Managers should approve the withdrawal before the poll ends to enable the member to withdraw the reward.
:::

This example script will set the rewardPollDuration to **3 days** (`259200` seconds) and the withdrawPollDuration to **7 days** (`604800` seconds). 

If you choose to automatically approve all polls, you should set `bypassPolls` to `true`. When finalizing a poll, the duration and vote counts will be ignored and the poll will automatically be approved.

**Request:**

```javascript
axios({
    url: 'https://api.thx.network/v1/asset_pools/0x278Ff6d33826D906070eE938CDc9788003749e93',
    method: 'PATCH',
    headers: {
        AssetPool: '0x278Ff6d33826D906070eE938CDc9788003749e93'
    },
    data: {
        bypassPolls: false,
        rewardPollDuration: 259200,
        proposeWithdrawPollDuration: 604800,
    }
})
```

## 3. Asset Pool Information

This example script will request information for asset pool `0x278Ff6d33826D906070eE938CDc9788003749e93`.

**Request:**
```javascript
axios({
    url: 'https://api.thx.network/v1/asset_pools/0x278Ff6d33826D906070eE938CDc9788003749e93',
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
        AssetPool: '0x278Ff6d33826D906070eE938CDc9788003749e93'
    },
})
```

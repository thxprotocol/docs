THX API uses layer 2 scaling solution [Polygon](https://www.polygon.technology) to be able to offer fast and cheap blockchain transactions. THX takes away the burdon of paying gas by relaying all contract state changing transactions to the API admin account which will be responsible for paying the networks gas fees in MATIC.

You can use the THX Web Wallet to move funds between layer 1 and 2.

:::info
Your layer 1 address will be identical to your layer 2 address, so make sure to have some ETH availble in that account if you decide to move your assets to layer 1.
